  ## Week Nine: Machine Building

  ### Making a Stepper Motor Machine

  <p> This week we learned how to use stepper motors. These stepper motors are perfect for calibrating the motors to move in specific parts, and turn the motor in specific degrees. Stepper motors have a really high reliability and come in so many different sizes to put in different machines, like desktop printers, 3d printers, and CNC milling machines. I decided that I would also work on my final project this week, because I have not started laser cutting the parts yet. </p>

  <p> I decided that I would incorporate a stepper motor into my final project if I had enough time at the end. The light for my final project is pretty solid right now, but adding in a moving part would make it even better. The stepper motor could go underneath my light in a little platform to hide the thick parts, and then spin the light on top of the platform. I could have have controls to control the speed. All of this is only if I have extra time at the end. </p>

   <p> To start this project, I needed to do the wiring to form the connection between the stepper motor and the Arduino plate. I followed the wiring sample listed on Nathan's website, and ended up with this:  </p>

  <p> I also used the sample code listed on the website to push to my stepper motor. The only thing I really had to change from this sample was the delay value, from 50 to 30, to make the motor spin faster. This was the first sample that I used: </p>

<pre><code class="language-arduino">
const int stepPin = 13;
const int dirPin = 12;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);

  digitalWrite(dirPin, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
  delay(30);
  digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
  delay(30);
}
</code></pre>

  <p> This is another version of the same code, but this time it came directly from the Arduino website:</p>

  <p> https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/StepperOneRevolution#code </p>

<pre><code class="language-arduino">
#include <Stepper.h>

const int stepsPerRevolution = 850;  // change this to fit the number of steps per revolution
// for your motor

// initialize the stepper library on pins 8 through 11:
Stepper myStepper(stepsPerRevolution, 12, 13);

void setup() {
  // set the speed at 60 rpm:
  myStepper.setSpeed(60);
  // initialize the serial port:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // step one revolution  in one direction:
  Serial.println("clockwise");
  myStepper.step(stepsPerRevolution);
  delay(700);

  // step one revolution in the other direction:
  Serial.println("counterclockwise");
  myStepper.step(-stepsPerRevolution);
  delay(500);
}
</code></pre>

  <p> The next order of business was to laser cut the pieces that I was going to use in my project this week. This was also a practice cut for the pieces involved in my final project. This is a little timeline of me lasercutting the pieces.</p>

  <p> One thing that I thought was really cool with this project was that I used blue acrylic to cut my pieces out (because it was the only one avaibale). It made me thin I might want to use colored acrylic on my final project aswell. </p>

  <p> After I cut the pieces, I realized I needed to make a different piece to fit on the bottom. I am not sure why I thought in my head at all of the pieces would fit together without a pentagon on the bottom, but I definetly made that mistake!</p> 

  ![image of laser cut](./machine9.jpeg) 

  <p> I then used the hot glue gun to put all of these pieces together, with the pentagon fitting perfectly on the bottom. I ended up with a small octangular half-bowl shape. </p>

  <p> At this point in the project, I was ready to connect my piece onto the stepper motor for it to spin. At first, the motor spun too fast (with the original code that had 50) so I changed it (to the 30 in the new code). These are some photos of the assembly and final product: </p>

  ### Calculating and Calibrating (into mm)

  <p> This part of the assignment was more mathmatical, with calibrating the motor and calculating the spin into mm. I found a calculation online that gave me the formula to switch the steps into microsteps and then into millimeters. The link to the website is below: </p>

  <p> https://www.phidgets.com/phorum/viewtopic.php?t=10422 </p>

   ![image of calculation](./machine16.jpeg) 
   ![image of calculation](./machine17.jpg) 

  <p> After following that calculation, I ended up with a value of 48,960 microsteps per millimeter, which is pretty high honestly. I followed this calculation, but I am still unsure if it really makes sense in the world of stepper motors. This calculation helped me to find the "home" spot on my stepper motor, which happened to be 850 steps away from the original position. </p>

  <p> For this project, the "home" spot doesnt automatically calculate if the value becomes greater or less than 850, but when 850 is included in the calculation, then it is perfect. If I wanted to move the motor to steps=0 I would have to do it by hand, but I can make one full rotation from that spot. </p>

  <p> I think this week was actually taught me a lot about positional movement, and even introduced the idea into my final project. </p>
