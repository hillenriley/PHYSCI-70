  ## Week Nine: Machine Building

  ### Making a Stepper Motor Machine

  <p> This week we learned how to use stepper motors. These stepper motors are perfect for calibrating the motors to move in specific parts, and turn the motor in specific degrees. Stepper motors have a really high reliability and come in so many different sizes to put in different machines, like desktop printers, 3d printers, and CNC milling machines. I decided that I would also work on my final project this week, because I have not started laser cutting the parts yet. </p>

  <p> I decided that I would incorporate a stepper motor into my final project if I had enough time at the end. The light for my final project is pretty solid right now, but adding in a moving part would make it even better. The stepper motor could go underneath my light in a little platform to hide the thick parts, and then spin the light on top of the platform. I could have have controls to control the speed. All of this is only if I have extra time at the end. </p>

   <p> To start this project, I needed to do the wiring to form the connection between the stepper motor and the Arduino plate. I followed the wiring sample listed on Nathan's website, and ended up with this:  </p>

  <p> I also used the sample code listed on the website to push to my stepper motor. The only thing I really had to change from this sample was the delay value, from 50 to 30, to make the motor spin faster. This was the first sample that I used: </p>

<pre><code class="language-arduino">
const int stepPin = 13;
const int dirPin = 12;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);

  digitalWrite(dirPin, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
  delay(30);
  digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
  delay(30);
}
</code></pre>

  <p> This is another version of the same code, but this time it came directly from the Arduino website:</p>

  <p> https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/StepperOneRevolution#code </p>

<pre><code class="language-arduino">

#include <Stepper.h>

const int stepsPerRevolution = 850;  // change this to fit the number of steps per revolution
// for your motor

// initialize the stepper library on pins 8 through 11:
Stepper myStepper(stepsPerRevolution, 12, 13);

void setup() {
  // set the speed at 60 rpm:
  myStepper.setSpeed(60);
  // initialize the serial port:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // step one revolution  in one direction:
  Serial.println("clockwise");
  myStepper.step(stepsPerRevolution);
  delay(700);

  // step one revolution in the other direction:
  Serial.println("counterclockwise");
  myStepper.step(-stepsPerRevolution);
  delay(500);
}
</code></pre>

  <p> The next order of business was to laser cut the pieces that I was going to use in my project this week. This was also a practice cut for the pieces involved in my final project. This is a little timeline of me lasercutting the pieces.</p>

  <p> After I cut the pieces, I realized I needed to make a different piece to fit on the bottom. I am not sure why I thought in my head at all of the pieces would fit together without a pentagon on the bottom, but I definetly made that mistake!</p> 

  ![image of laser cut](./machine9.jpeg) 

  <p> I then used the hot glue gun to put all of these pieces together, with the pentagon fitting perfectly on the bottom. I ended up with a small octangular half-bowl shape. </p>

  <p> And this is the link to the more specific RandomNerd tutorial that I used for my project this week:</p>

  <p> https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-web-server-arduino-ide/</p>

  <p> Following the tutorial was really easy, even though it was really long. The tutorial actually even provided me with code that would work for my Arduino completely, and I only had to change a couple of things. </p>

  <p> **I'm not sure why this code looks so weird** </p>

  <p> Since I was not working within the MAKERSPACE wifi range, I also had my friend make a wifi network from his computer, which allowed me to connect mhy Arduino to it and get the IP adress. </p>

  <p> This is a little timeline of me following the tutorial: </p>

  ![image of Arduino](./radio12.jpeg) 

  <p> As shown in the above photos, the output of this project was to have the different LED lights change based on the input from the website. This was actually the coolest part because I realized I could contol the lights from any device, so I plugged in the IP adress into my friends phone and started turning them on and off from that. </p> 

  <p> These were the final outputs from this weeks project: </p>

  <p> I honestly wish I could have done just a little bit more this week, either using Firebase or another networking system, but all of the problems with my Arduino and ESP32 connection really held me back. In the future, especially with my final project, I am excited to dive deeper into this concept to incorporate wifi into my projects! </p>
