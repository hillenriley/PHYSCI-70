  ## Temperatus Lux
  #### Completed Final Project Documentation

  ![image of temperatus lux](./lux1.jpeg)

  <p> My final project is the Temperatus Lux. In Latin, this means "tmperature light" and it is just that. This light is able to measure the surrounding air temperature through a thermistor and output that data through an LED light display.</p>

  ### Completed Project Video

  ### Arduino LED Code
  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
define PIN        6
define NUMPIXELS 60

int ThermistorPin = A0;
int Vo;
float R1 = 10000;
float R2, T;
float A = 3.354e-03;
float B = 2.5698e-4;

Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  strip.begin(); // INITIALIZE NeoPixel strip object (REQUIRED)
  strip.show();            // Turn OFF all pixels ASAP
  strip.setBrightness(100); // Set BRIGHTNESS low to reduce draw (max = 255)
}

void loop() {

  Vo = analogRead(ThermistorPin);
  R2 = R1 * 1 / (1023.0 / (float)Vo - 1.0); //Calculate resistance of thermistor from voltage divider math.
  T = (1.0 / (A + B * log(R2 / R1) )); // Calculate temperature using datasheet formula.
  T = T - 273.15;                   //Convert from Kelvin to Celcius
  Serial.println(T);
  // strip.clear(); // Set all pixel colors to 'off'
  // for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      // strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(0, 150, 0));
  // }
  if (T <= 22.71) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(12,64,168));
      strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.
  }} else if (T >= 22.73) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(183,208,255));
      strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.
  }} else {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color (108,148,230));
      strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.
    }}

  ### Future Changes
   <p> Making Future Changes:</p>
   <p> In order to make thisproject better, there would be some changes in the future that I could impliment to bring temperatus lux to a whole new level. First, I would go back and change the top on the base where the acrylic sheet is attached. This piece has too many openings which let out the LED light from the bottom. With a smaller base piece, the light coming from the LED would be much more focused and would probably make the acrlyic shine brighter even with the lights on. Another piece that I would change in this project would be to use clear acrylic for the main light display instead of colored. My project went through two different color displays, blue and the drak gray that I currently have, and I wish I would have been able to use acrylic. The lack of clear acrylic was just purely bas luck because we ran out in the lab right before I went to cut, and it was tight with everyone making their final projects, I decided just to settle for colored. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p> Looking in Future Directions:</p>
   <p> In order to make Temperatus Lux an actual product in the future, the whole manufacturing process would need to be taken up a notch. My craftworking skills are decent for pretty much just starting, but some things were definetly lacking. To make the whole base look more clean, 3D parts could probably be printed and assembled to take away the wood component. Having a cleaner product would look better overall. </p>
   <p> In the future, if I wanted to make this project more worthy in the eyes of consumers, I could make the temperature range greater, and have it almost act as a daily thermometer for people when they are picking out outfits or looking for the temperature during the day. It could even be good for children who are still learning how to read temperatures, and could act as a fun learning tool.</p>
  
  ### Reflection Process
  <p> I have really enjoyed my time spent building, not only the final project, but all of the projects during this short semester. I have learned the most during these seven weeks that I have in my entire life, not only about building and coding, but also about myself. I am so happy to have been enrolled in this class, and thankful for such an amazing group of people surrounding me everyday in the lab. </p>
