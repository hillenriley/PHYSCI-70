  ### Week 4: 3D Printing

  <p> This week we started talking about how to use the 3d printers and make our own print. In order to do this, we made sample designs in Fusion (I used OnShape because I'm an onshape girly) and then transported that design into Prusa software. In Prusa we were able to change some of the dimensions and orientations, as well as set the printing speeds and see the timing on the actual printer. At first, this software really confused me but with some practice it wasnt as bad as I thought. </p>

  <p> For this project specifically I decided to stick with my animal theme and I decided on a small fish that mirrored the style of my dinosaur. I looked on google for some images of these small fish structures (links below) and I decided on my design. This fish was so small that I was actually able to make it into a keychain for my lanyard by putting the key look through the fishes eye hole. </p>

  <p> I created my design pretty easily on OnShape and extruded the images while I was getting the printer ready to print. These were my designs below:</p>

  <p> I then went back and did some of the circuit examples from the website. At first, none of the circuits were working for me but I realized I never plugged in the power! These circuits were pretty easy and I decided for my project I was going to expand on these. </p>

  <p> In order to write my own code, Kassia helped me look at samples for button use. She showed me the linked website below which really helped. Check it out! </p>

  <p> https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-button-toggle-led/</p>

  <p> At this stage in the process I began writing my own code now. My goal was to have my dinosaur object spin when the button was pressed and stop spinng when the user took their finger off the button. Below are some code snipbits that helped me to make my project. </p>

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
const int buttonPin = 2;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin =  13;      // the number of the LED pin
const int A1A = 3;  // define pin 3 for A-1A 
const int A1B = 4;  // define pin 4 for A-1B 

// variables will change:
int lastButtonState;         // read last button state (press)
int currentButtonState;      // read current button state (press) 

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);

  // currentButtonstate = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     // specify these pins as outputs
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // start with the motors off 
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  lastButtonState = currentButtonState;       // remembering the last button press state
  currentButtonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);  // saving the new state compared to old state

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  if (lastButtonState == HIGH) {
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    // start the motor 
    digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);   
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    // delay(2000);  // makes button spin for a certain amount of time
    // keep delay off for the motor to only spin when button is pressed 
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
  }
}
  </code></pre> 

  <p> I also made some drawings of the final wire set up that I decided to use for my project, as well as the final circuit board design. I am not the best at drawing circuits, so it may seem a little janky, but I tried my best with the physics knowledge that I had stored in the back of my brain! </p>

  <p> Once I finally got all my code together and my project assembled I was finally done, or so I thought. My project worked really good, however, the weight distribution was slightly off because one side of the dinosaur was heavier than the other. I decided to remedy this by putting a heavy nut on one side of the dinosaurs feet to distrubute the weight better. </p>

  <p> This week really taught me that I always should be open to learning new things, and even making changes to something when I think it is perfect.</p>
