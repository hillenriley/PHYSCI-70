  ### Week 4: 3D Printing

  <p> This week we started talking about how to use the 3d printers and make our own print. In order to do this, we made sample designs in Fusion (I used OnShape because I'm an onshape girly) and then transported that design into Prusa software. In Prusa we were able to change some of the dimensions and orientations, as well as set the printing speeds and see the timing on the actual printer. At first, this software really confused me but with some practice it wasnt as bad as I thought. </p>

  <p> For this project specifically I decided to stick with my animal theme and I decided on a small fish that mirrored the style of my dinosaur. I looked on google for some images of these small fish structures (links below) and I decided on my design. This fish was so small that I was actually able to make it into a keychain for my lanyard by putting the key look through the fishes eye hole. </p>

  <p> I created my design pretty easily on OnShape and extruded the images while I was getting the printer ready to print. These were my designs below:</p>

  <p> After making my designs, I exported my work from OnShape into Prusa. I then took that STL file and simplified it down into a G-code, which gives the printer instructions on how to print the design. The G-code was then moved onto a flashdrive with an SD-card, and that card was then put into the 3d printer. </p>

  <p> These are downloadable versions of both my G-codes and my STLs:</p>




  <p> Once I loaded up my file, I pressed start and waited the 25 minutes for my fish to be done. The whole point of this assignment was to make something that cannot be easily reproduced by another way of building things, like the laser cutter or any hand tools. In order to fufill this part of the assignment I filleted the edges of the fish around it's head because that could not really be done well with the laser cutter. The filleted edges made the head of the fish look less sharp and more realistic than other parts of the printed fish.</p>

  <p> This specifically is the filleted edge on the head:</p>

  <p> Even though I really onlt added the filleted part to fufill the assignment, I am glad I did in the end. I am actually really happy with how my fish turned out. Since it was so small, I was able to use my fish as a keychain on my lanyard (photo attached below).</p>
