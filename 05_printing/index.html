  ### Week 4: 3D Printing

  <p> This week we started talking about how to use the 3d printers and make our own print. In order to do this, we made sample designs in Fusion (I used OnShape because I'm an onshape girly) and then transported that design into Prusa software. In Prusa we were able to change some of the dimensions and orientations, as well as set the printing speeds and see the timing on the actual printer. At first, this software really confused me but with some practice it wasnt as bad as I thought. </p>

  <p> For this project specifically I decided to stick with my animal theme and I decided on a small fish that mirrored the style of my dinosaur. I looked on google for some images of these small fish structures (links below) and I decided on my design. This fish was so small that I was actually able to make it into a keychain for my lanyard by putting the key look through the fishes eye hole. </p>

  <p> I created my design pretty easily on OnShape and extruded the images while I was getting the printer ready to print. These were my designs below:</p>

  <p> After making my designs, I exported my work from OnShape into Prusa. I then took that STL file and simplified it down into a G-code, which gives the printer instructions on how to print the design. The G-code was then moved onto a flashdrive with an SD-card, and that card was then put into the 3d printer. </p>

  <p> This is the downloadable version of my STL file:</p>

  <p> This is the downloadable version of my G-code file:</p>

  <p> Once I loaded up my file, I pressed start and waited the 25 minutes for my fish to be done. The whole point of this assignment was to make something that cannot be easily reproduced by another way of building things, like the laser cutter or any hand tools. In order to fufill this part of the assignment I filleted the edges of the fish around it's head because that could not really be done well with the laser cutter. The filleted edges made the head of the fish look less sharp and more realistic than other parts of the printed fish.</p>

  <p> This specifically is the filleted edge on the head:</p>

  <p> Even though I really onlt added the filleted part to fufill the assignment, I am glad I did in the end. I am actually really happy with how my fish turned out. Since it was so small, I was able to use my fish as a keychain on my lanyard (photo attached below).</p>

  <p> For this assignment, we also spent time talking about photogammetry. This process allows 3D models to be made of pretty much anything by submitting photos to an online application. I learned that the more photos you take the better the results turn out to be. When I tried doing this, I realized that my phone did not have a LiDar scanner so my options for making the scan were pretty limited. I ended up using an application called "Megascan" that took photos of the object on my phone and then stiched all the photos together to make a model.</p>

  <p> This is how my 3D scan turned out using MegaScan:</p>

  <p> Obviously, just by looking at the file, this scan is not the best. I tried my best for the limited technology that I had (and by limited I mean that my phone did not come with a built-in LiDar scanner) and I think for it being my first time it was somewhat decent. This topic of scanning was actually really interesting and something I will definetly pursue again in the future at some point. </p>
