  ### Project Planning Page 

  <p> This week we started with planning out our final project. I am thinking that I want to do something with measuring heartrate and having that change the color and music displayed on a speaker. </p>

  <p> The user could possibly wear some sort of smart watch or chest heart monitor in order to record the heart rate, and then that data can be sent to the speaker to change its properties. This speaker could try to help reduce anxiety, if the users heart rate is too fast then light colors could be displayed on the speaker. </p>

   <p> This was my first idea: </p>

  <p> I have to look into the information surrounding speaker shapes to have the most optimal sound dispersion. The pieces for the speaker could probably be 3d printed and then put together to get a nice shape. </p>

  <p> These are some possible shapes: </p>

  <p> After looking into which speaker shapes I should consider, I am also planning on looking into whether the speaker should only have the lights controlled by the heartrate, but possibly also the type (and tempo) of the music also be controlled by the user's heart </p>

  <p> Previous studies that are similar to this include some fitness watches, like popular Fitbits and Apple watches that monitor a user's heart rate while completing various activities, like swimming, running a marathon, or doing a simple workout. My project could also end up being similar to prevoiusly existing speakers that change colors depending on the tempo of the song, or even just color changing speakers as a whole. </p>

  <p> With this project, I hope to accomplish and create some sort of speaker that can help with reducing anxiety and other bad mental states. This is extremely important in modern society with the immersion of various mental health diagnoises. My speaker could be a solution to reducing some of the tensions caused by the mental illnesses, and would probably be the best suited for students located on college campuses who face large loads of stress daily. </p>

  ## Update as of July 6th

  <p> I have really begun to start thinking about how I am going to execute this project. After talking to Suvin, I think that my biggest goal to accomplish first is creating the actual speaker, and then having the heart rate scanner come second. After thinking about this part too, I think it would probably be more beneficial (and easier) to use a temperature body scanner instead of a heart rate monitor. The colors can then change based on your body temperature instead of how fast your heart is beating.</p>

  <p> My backup plan for this project if all else fails is to just make a lamp that will change based on your body temperature, but I have high hopes that I will be able to create the speaker aswell.</p>

  <p> I am still working on a list of parts for this project, however, this is my first drafted list:</p>

  <p> - acrylic for the outside of the speaker (to lasercut)
      - speaker components (still looking into the specifics)
      - wood (only a little bit for the base of the speaker)
  </p>

  <p> I have also been looking into different videos and articles on how exactly to construct the speaker, and these are some of the examples I have come across for right now: </p>
