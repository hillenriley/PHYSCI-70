  Week 1: Introduction and Review

  <p> We started this week with thinking of ideas about what our final projects should be. I am currently thinking about making some sort of speaker that can sinc with a users heart rate, with either the colors or light displays. </p>

  <P> The user could wear some sort of heart monitor band, either on their finger or wrist, and that could send signals to the speaker to change the music and colors based on their heart rate. </p>

  <p> If their heart rate is fast, the colors and song could change to become more slow to calm down the user. The user also should probably have some sort of input from their side of the watch, but I'm not sure how I want to do that yet. </p>

  Here is an image:
