  ### Week 1: Introduction and Project Planning

  <p> This week we started with planning out our final project. I am thinking that I want to do something with measuring heartrate and having that change the color and music displayed on a speaker. </p>

  <p> The user could possibly wear some sort of smart watch or chest heart monitor in order to record the heart rate, and then that data can be sent to the speaker to change its properties. This speaker could try to help reduce anxiety, if the users heart rate is too fast then light colors could be displayed on the speaker. </p>

  <p> I have to look into the information surrounding speaker shapes to have the most optimal sound dispersion. The pieces for the speaker could probably be 3d printed and then put together to get a nice shape. </p>

  <p> These were my original ideas: </p>
