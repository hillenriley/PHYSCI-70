  ## Week Three: Electronics and Tools 

  ### Creating Kinetic Sculpture

  <p> This week we talked about the laser cutter, Arduino switch boards, and soldering materials together onto motors. I have never really soldered before so this first step was somewhat a challenge for me. After getting over my fear of burning myself, I realized that it actually was not that hard and pretty managable compared to other things we do in this lab. Kassia also taught me how to use glue and I am very thankful for her!! </p>

  <p> the first thing I had to do to begin this week was to brainstorm some ideas of what to build. Originally, I was going to build a model of the solar system but that seemed not original enough for this class. I really like museusms and I realized that I could do some kind of museum exhibit that spins around, and I was thinking I could use a dinosaur on the top. </p>

   <p> This was my original sketch: </p>

  <p> I put this idea into OnShape and began designing. These were the models I came up with: </p>

  <p> After designing, I realized how packed the laser cutter was getting so I joined the cue to cut all of my parts by the end of the lab time. This was definetly the most stressful part because everyone was trying to do it at the same time. I ended up having to cut my pieces in three separate batches because I kept forgetting things in my design. The box on the bottom of the structure took me the longest because I kept messing up the dimensions. </p>

  <p> Once I had all of my pieces cut, I began gluing them together with a hot glue gun. Shout out to Kassia for teaching me how to use it!! The most difficult part of gluing was not being able to lay the motor down flat and having a weird space in between the motor and the cardboard. </p>

  <p> After plugging the Arduino board into my computer for a power source, I learned which wires to plug into the sources to power my project. The red and the black wires really only decide which way the dinosaur would spin. Arduino seemed complicated but it was actually really easy once you get the hang of it. I think that my project turned out really good overall even though I was learning as I was going!! </p>

  <p> This was my final project: </p>

  ### Using a Multimeter

  <p> I did not get to use the multimeter in my section lab meeting because everyone was very frantic and there was no time, however, I will measure the voltages in the future! </p>
