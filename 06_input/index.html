  ### Week Five: Electronic Input Devices

  <p> This week we started learning about electronic input devices. The main goal of this week was learning how to get data from our circuit systems and find the minimum and maximum values for that data. In order to find the minimum and maximum values, I had to look at both the output pages and the graphs (shown in photos below) to find the highest and lowest numbers.  </p>

  <p> After looking at all of the circuit designs, I decided to use a Tx Rx touch sensor for the first part of this assignment. This circuit was actually really easy to build in comparison to past circuits we have made in this class. All I really had to do was have one wire come into the - and another wire go into the - port, and then i connected those smaller wires to longer alligator clips. I then connected those clips to the copper paper. All I had to do to collect data was place the pieces of paper together and watch the graphs. </p>

   <p> This was the process of making the circuit: </p>

  <p> I have to look into the information surrounding speaker shapes to have the most optimal sound dispersion. The pieces for the speaker could probably be 3d printed and then put together to get a nice shape. </p>

  <p> These are some possible shapes: </p>

  <p> After looking into which speaker shapes I should consider, I am also planning on looking into whether the speaker should only have the lights controlled by the heartrate, but possibly also the type (and tempo) of the music also be controlled by the user's heart </p>

  <p> Previous studies that are similar to this include some fitness watches, like popular Fitbits and Apple watches that monitor a user's heart rate while completing various activities, like swimming, running a marathon, or doing a simple workout. My project could also end up being similar to prevoiusly existing speakers that change colors depending on the tempo of the song, or even just color changing speakers as a whole. </p>

  <p> With this project, I hope to accomplish and create some sort of speaker that can help with reducing anxiety and other bad mental states. This is extremely important in modern society with the immersion of various mental health diagnoises. My speaker could be a solution to reducing some of the tensions caused by the mental illnesses, and would probably be the best suited for students located on college campuses who face large loads of stress daily. </p>

  ## Update as of July 6th

  <p> I have really begun to start thinking about how I am going to execute this project. After talking to Suvin, I think that my biggest goal to accomplish first is creating the actual speaker, and then having the heart rate scanner come second. After thinking about this part too, I think it would probably be more beneficial (and easier) to use a temperature body scanner instead of a heart rate monitor. The colors can then change based on your body temperature instead of how fast your heart is beating.</p>

  <p> My backup plan for this project if all else fails is to just make a lamp that will change based on your body temperature, but I have high hopes that I will be able to create the speaker aswell.</p>

  <p> I am still working on a list of parts for this project, however, this is my first drafted list:</p>

  <p> - acrylic for the outside of the speaker (to lasercut) </p>
  <p> - speaker components (still looking into the specifics) </p>
  <p> - wood (only a little bit for the base of the speaker) </p>

  <p> I have also been looking into different videos and articles on how exactly to construct the speaker and/or lamp, and these are some of the examples I have come across for right now: </p>
