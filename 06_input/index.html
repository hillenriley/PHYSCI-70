  ### Week Five: Electronic Input Devices

  <p> This week we started learning about electronic input devices. The main goal of this week was learning how to get data from our circuit systems and find the minimum and maximum values for that data. In order to find the minimum and maximum values, I had to look at both the output pages and the graphs (shown in photos below) to find the highest and lowest numbers.  </p>

  # Part One

  <p> After looking at all of the circuit designs, I decided to use a Tx Rx touch sensor for the first part of this assignment. This circuit was actually really easy to build in comparison to past circuits we have made in this class. All I really had to do was have one wire come into the - and another wire go into the - port, and then i connected those smaller wires to longer alligator clips. I then connected those clips to the copper paper. All I had to do to collect data was place the pieces of paper together and watch the graphs. </p>

   <p> This was the process of making the circuit: </p>

  <p> This was the code that I used to collect my data (all credit goes to Nathan's website!!!!!): </p>

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
int analog_pin = A3;
int tx_pin = 4;
int read_high;
int read_low;
int diff; 

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      // Pin 4 provides the voltage step
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);           // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
    read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);  // Measure response of conductor 2.
    delayMicroseconds(100);              // Delay to reach steady state.
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);            // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
    read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);   // Measure response of conductor 2.
    diff = read_high - read_low;         // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
    Serial.println(diff);
}
  </code></pre>

  <p> I also looked at the serial monitor and serial output graph pages in order to get my minimum and maximum values. To get the minimum, I held my pieces of copper very far away from each other, and to get the maximum, I pressed the pieces ontop of each other very close together. </p>

  <p> My minimum and maximum values are shown below on the serial outputs: </p> 

  <p> Minimum: 2</p>

  ![image of minimum](./minimum.png)

  <p> Maximum: 14 naturally (15 when pressed together really tight)</p>

  ![image of maximum](./maximum.png)

  <p> I also was able to get graph values for this circuit. The dips and jumps in the graphs represent when I pressed the pieces together and when I took them apart. This is how they turned out: </p>

  # Part Two

  <p> The second part of this assignment was to use another sensor to create a similar circuit using outside materials. After looking at the sample codes on the website, I decided to use a thermistor to detect changes in temperature. The circuit was not too hard to build because there was diagrams shown on the website (credit to Nathan's website!) </p>

  ![image of making circuits](./makingcircuits4.jpeg)

  <p> This was the code I used for this sensor (once again all the credit for programming goes to Nathan!!!!): </p>

  <p> The only thing I changed with this code was I added "ln" after the print statement to see the lines for my graph. </p>

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
int ThermistorPin = A0;
int Vo;
float R1 = 10000;
float R2, T;
float A = 3.354e-03;
float B = 2.5698e-4;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);           
}

void loop() {

  Vo = analogRead(ThermistorPin);
  R2 = R1 * 1/(1023.0 / (float)Vo - 1.0);  //Calculate resistance of thermistor from voltage divider math.
  T = (1.0 / (A + B*log(R2/R1) ));  // Calculate temperature using datasheet formula.
  T = T - 273.15;                   //Convert from Kelvin to Celcius.


 // Serial.print("Temperature: "); 
  Serial.println(T);
 // Serial.println("C"); 

  delay(500);
}
  </code></pre>

  <p> I used the same process (pretty much) with this sensor in finding the minimum and maximum values. Since this was a temperature sensor, in order to find the minimum, I pressed ice cubes against the senors, and to find the maximum I heated up my hands and put them on the sensor. The only challenging part of this part was finding ice cubes, which thanks to Emma we aquired from the Clover resturant in the lobby of the building.  </p>

  ![image of ice](./coldice.jpeg)

  <p> These were the maximum and minimum values that I was able to collect after repeating that process a couple of times: </p>

  <p> Minimum (from ice): 15.83 C</p>

  ![image of ice temp](./icetemp2.png)

  <p> Maximum (from hand): 30.72 C</p>

  <p> This was also the graph from the data that I collected: </p>

  <p> I am very glad we learned about electronic input circuits this week because I am planning on using a thermistor in my final project. For my final project, I finally decided I want to make a light that changes based off of body temperature, and in order to do that I will need a temperature sensor that I can attach to a bracelet for the user to wear. I will have to learn more about transmitting data throguh wifi while making my final project, but that is a lesson to learn for the future. </p>
