  ## Week Six: Electronic Output Devices

  ### Using a New Output Device

  <p> This week we learned about electronic output devices, the opposite of what we did last week. Electronic output devices take information and output data in the form of sensors, like the LED strips or the music box sensor.  The assignment for this week was to use an output sensor that you have never used before. After learning about all of my different options, I decided yo go with an LED strip because I wanted to use it within my final project. </p>

  <p> This week was actually perfect for planning my final project because the I was going to have to use both the input and output sensors. Since I was already planning on using them later in the semester, this was just really preparation to get the code and everything working. My idea was to have my tepmperature input scanner (from last week) change the color out LED output strips based on the temperature. This relates back to my final project because I want to have the lights on my display be based off of a user's bosy temperature. </p>

   <p> In order to start this whole process, I first had to solder wires to my LED strip, and hotglue the solder down: </p>

  <p> After that, I began following the tutorial on Nathan's website in order to have the right wire connections for the LED to light up. </p>

  <p> This part took me three tries to get it to work, and a couple more soldered wires to the LED strip, but I was happy with the result. I even changed the LED's to purple (my favorite color)!! </p>

  <p> My biggest learning curve throughout this whole project, and maybe even the whole class, is the programming language we uae. Coming into this class, I had a little experience with HTML and CSS, but most of my experience came from Python. Arduino programmers, however, use C++, which is completely foreign to me. Below is a snitbit of the code I used from the sample for this project. </p>

  ![image of code](./code.png)

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>

#define PIN        6
#define NUMPIXELS 14
// #define DELAYVAL 500 // Time (in milliseconds) to pause between pixels

int ThermistorPin = A0;
int Vo;
float R1 = 10000;
float R2, T;
float A = 3.354e-03;
float B = 2.5698e-4;

Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  strip.begin(); // INITIALIZE NeoPixel strip object (REQUIRED)
  strip.show();            // Turn OFF all pixels ASAP
  strip.setBrightness(40); // Set BRIGHTNESS low to reduce draw (max = 255)
}

void loop() {

  Vo = analogRead(ThermistorPin);
  R2 = R1 * 1 / (1023.0 / (float)Vo - 1.0); //Calculate resistance of thermistor from voltage divider math.
  T = (1.0 / (A + B * log(R2 / R1) )); // Calculate temperature using datasheet formula.
  T = T - 273.15;                   //Convert from Kelvin to Celcius
  Serial.println(T);
  strip.clear(); // Set all pixel colors to 'off'
  // for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      // strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(0, 150, 0));
  // }
  if (T <= 37.0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(0, 0, 150));
      strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.
  }} else if (T >= 40.50) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(150, 0, 0));
      strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.
  }} else {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(150, 0, 150));
      strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.
    }}

}
  </code></pre>

  <p>  After figuring out what I wanted the code to do it was pretty simple to write it, with a little bit of help with my syntax from Kassia! My code is basically just saying for the LED to start at room temperature (purple) and then if it detects a temperature larger than 40.50 degrees celsius to change to red, and if a temperature is smaller than 37.0 degrees celsius to change to blue. These colors minmic the normal color patterns, which is something I wanted to do in my final project. </p>

  <p> In order to get the ranges for my code, I had to test out the different termperatures and see what the minimum and maximum values were. Last weeks project really helped me out with this part because I knew exactly what i should be looking for. There were the ranges I found for my normal range, my high range, and my low range (shown below in that order): </p>

  <p> I also made use of the Adafruit NeoPixel libraries in order to input all of the information about the LED's. Shoutout to NeoPixel!</p>

  <p> At one point, I actually even made my LED strip ombre on accdient. </p>

  ### Using an oscilloscope

  <p> For this assignment, we also had to use an oscilloscope to discover the time domain in which our output devices were operating at. This was a completely new machine to me, but with Kassia and Suvin's explanations, it became pretty simple. All we had to do was connect one prong to the middle wire, and the other prong to the grounding wire, and read the values shown on the screen. </p>

  <p> This is what mine looked like when I read my values: </p>

  <p> Reading the oscilloscope was slightly harder. This is how I was able to answer the proposed questions from the assignment: </p>

  <p> Is it on a fixed clock? The time domain for this machine showed 20.00μs, which I believe is relating back to the force of friction. I took physics this year and the symbol "μ" is usually representative of the force of friction value. I do not believe this oscilloscope is on a fixed clock because of the fact that we can change all of the values with the buttons and knobs on the side of the machine, but I could be wrong.</p>

  <p> What's its speed? The oscilloscope presented that there was 19.5159 Hz, which I am pretty sure is speed. Herz measures how many cycles an object goes through in one second, so this value would be the closest measured value to speed. </p>

  Here is a video of how my whole project turned out in the end:

  <p> The last part of this assignment was to create Fusion (or in my case OnShape) designs for next weeks CNC cutting lesson. I tried making a stand to rest my laptop on while doing homework in my dorm. These were the main designs I came up with: </p>
