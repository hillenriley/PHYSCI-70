  ## Week Six: Electronic Output Devices

  ### Using a New Output Device

  <p> This week we learned about electronic output devices, the opposite of what we did last week. Electronic output devices take information and output data in the form of sensors, like the LED strips or the music box sensor.  The assignment for this week was to use an output sensor that you have never used before. After learning about all of my different options, I decided yo go with an LED strip because I wanted to use it within my final project. </p>

  <p> This week was actually perfect for planning my final project because the I was going to have to use both the input and output sensors. Since I was already planning on using them later in the semester, this was just really preparation to get the code and everything working. My idea was to have my tepmperature input scanner (from last week) change the color out LED output strips based on the temperature. This relates back to my final project because I want to have the lights on my display be based off of a user's bosy temperature. </p>

   <p> In order to start this whole process, I first had to solder wires to my LED strip, and hotglue the solder down: </p>

  <p> After that, I began following the tutorial on Nathan's website in order to have the right wire connections for the LED to light up. </p>

  <p> This part took me three tries to get it to work, and a couple more soldered wires to the LED strip, but I was happy with the result. I even changed the LED's to purple (my favorite color)!! </p>

  <p> My biggest learning curve throughout this whole project, and maybe even the whole class, is the programming language we uae. Coming into this class, I had a little experience with HTML and CSS, but most of my experience came from Python. Arduino programmers, however, use C++, which is completely foreign to me. Below is a snitbit of the code I used from the sample for this project. </p>

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>

#define PIN        6
#define NUMPIXELS 14
// #define DELAYVAL 500 // Time (in milliseconds) to pause between pixels

int ThermistorPin = A0;
int Vo;
float R1 = 10000;
float R2, T;
float A = 3.354e-03;
float B = 2.5698e-4;

Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  strip.begin(); // INITIALIZE NeoPixel strip object (REQUIRED)
  strip.show();            // Turn OFF all pixels ASAP
  strip.setBrightness(40); // Set BRIGHTNESS low to reduce draw (max = 255)
}

void loop() {

  Vo = analogRead(ThermistorPin);
  R2 = R1 * 1 / (1023.0 / (float)Vo - 1.0); //Calculate resistance of thermistor from voltage divider math.
  T = (1.0 / (A + B * log(R2 / R1) )); // Calculate temperature using datasheet formula.
  T = T - 273.15;                   //Convert from Kelvin to Celcius
  Serial.println(T);
  strip.clear(); // Set all pixel colors to 'off'
  // for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      // strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(0, 150, 0));
  // }
  if (T <= 37.0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(0, 0, 150));
      strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.
  }} else if (T >= 40.50) {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(150, 0, 0));
      strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.
  }} else {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...
      strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(150, 0, 150));
      strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.
    }}

}

  <p>  After figuring out what I wanted the code to do it was pretty simple to write it, with a little bit of help with my syntax from Kassia! My code is basically just saying for the LED to start at room temperature (purple) and then if it detects a temperature larger than 40.50 degrees celsius to change to red, and if a temperature is smaller than 37.0 degrees celsius to change to blue. These colors minmic the normal color patterns, which is something I wanted to do in my final project. </p>

  <p> I also made use of the Adafruit NeoPixel libraries in order to input all of the information about the LED's. Shoutout to NeoPixel!</p>

  <p> At one point, I actually even made my LED strip ombre on accdient. </p>

  ### Using an oscilloscope

  <p> For this assignment, we also had to use an oscilloscope to discover the time domain in which our output devices were operating at. This was a completely new machine to me, but with Kassia and Suvin's explanations, it became pretty simple. All we had to do was connect one prong to the middle wire, and the other prong to the grounding wire, and read the values shown on the screen. </p>

  <p> This is what mine looked like when I read my values: </p>

  <p> I also was able to get graph values for this circuit. The dips and jumps in the graphs represent when I pressed the pieces together and when I took them apart. This is how they turned out: </p>

  ### Part Two (Thermistor Sensor)

  <p> The second part of this assignment was to use another sensor to create a similar circuit using outside materials. After looking at the sample codes on the website, I decided to use a thermistor to detect changes in temperature. The circuit was not too hard to build because there was diagrams shown on the website (credit to Nathan's website!) </p>

  ![image of making circuits](./makingcircuits3.jpeg)
  ![image of making circuits](./makingcircuits4.jpeg)

  <p> This was the code I used for this sensor (once again all the credit for programming goes to Nathan!!!!): </p>

  <p> The only thing I changed with this code was I added "ln" after the print statement to see the lines for my graph. </p>

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
int ThermistorPin = A0;
int Vo;
float R1 = 10000;
float R2, T;
float A = 3.354e-03;
float B = 2.5698e-4;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);           
}

void loop() {

  Vo = analogRead(ThermistorPin);
  R2 = R1 * 1/(1023.0 / (float)Vo - 1.0);  //Calculate resistance of thermistor from voltage divider math.
  T = (1.0 / (A + B*log(R2/R1) ));  // Calculate temperature using datasheet formula.
  T = T - 273.15;                   //Convert from Kelvin to Celcius.


 // Serial.print("Temperature: "); 
  Serial.println(T);
 // Serial.println("C"); 

  delay(500);
}
  </code></pre>

  <p> I used the same process (pretty much) with this sensor in finding the minimum and maximum values. Since this was a temperature sensor, in order to find the minimum, I pressed ice cubes against the senors, and to find the maximum I heated up my hands and put them on the sensor. The only challenging part of this part was finding ice cubes, which thanks to Emma we aquired from the Clover resturant in the lobby of the building. To control the range, all I had to do was change what object was touching the temperature sensor (cold ice or hot hand). </p>

  ![image of hand](./hothand.jpeg)
  ![image of ice](./coldice.jpeg)

  <p> These were the maximum and minimum values that I was able to collect after repeating that process a couple of times: </p>

  #### Minimum (from ice): 15.83 C

  ![image of ice temp](./icetemp2.png)

  #### Maximum (from hand): 30.72 C

  ![image of hand temp](./blowingtemp.png)

  <p> This was also the graph from the data that I collected: </p>

  ![image of graph](./graph3.png)

  <p> I am very glad we learned about electronic input circuits this week because I am planning on using a thermistor in my final project. For my final project, I finally decided I want to make a light that changes based off of body temperature, and in order to do that I will need a temperature sensor that I can attach to a bracelet for the user to wear. I will have to learn more about transmitting data throguh wifi while making my final project, but that is a lesson to learn for the future. </p>
