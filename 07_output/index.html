  ## Week Six: Electronic Output Devices

  <p> This week we learned about electronic output devices, the opposite of what we did last week. Electronic output devices take information and output data in the form of sensors, like the LED strips or the music box sensor.  The assignment for this week was to use an output sensor that you have never used before. After learning about all of my different options, I decided yo go with an LED strip because I wanted to use it within my final project. </p>

  <p> This week was actually perfect for planning my final project because the I was going to have to use both the input and output sensors. Since I was already planning on using them later in the semester, this was just really preparation to get the code and everything working. My idea was to have my tepmperature input scanner (from last week) change the color out LED output strips based on the temperature. This relates back to my final project because I want to have the lights on my display be based off of a user's bosy temperature. </p>

   <p> In order to start this whole process, I first had to solder wires to my LED strip, and hotglue the solder down: </p>

  <p> This was the code that I used to collect my data (all credit goes to Nathan's website!!!!!): </p>

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
int analog_pin = A3;
int tx_pin = 4;
int read_high;
int read_low;
int diff; 

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);      // Pin 4 provides the voltage step
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);           // Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
    read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);  // Measure response of conductor 2.
    delayMicroseconds(100);              // Delay to reach steady state.
    digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);            // Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
    read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);   // Measure response of conductor 2.
    diff = read_high - read_low;         // desired answer is the difference between high and low.
    Serial.println(diff);
}
  </code></pre>

  <p> I also looked at the serial monitor and serial output graph pages in order to get my minimum and maximum values. To get the minimum, I held my pieces of copper very far away from each other, and to get the maximum, I pressed the pieces ontop of each other very close together. In order to control the range, all I had to do was move the pieces closer together and further apart to change the recorded values. </p>

  <p> My minimum and maximum values are shown below on the serial outputs: </p> 

  #### Minimum: 2

  ![image of minimum](./minimum.png)

  #### Maximum: 14 naturally (15 when pressed together really tight)

  ![image of maximum](./maximum.png)

  <p> I also was able to get graph values for this circuit. The dips and jumps in the graphs represent when I pressed the pieces together and when I took them apart. This is how they turned out: </p>

  ### Part Two (Thermistor Sensor)

  <p> The second part of this assignment was to use another sensor to create a similar circuit using outside materials. After looking at the sample codes on the website, I decided to use a thermistor to detect changes in temperature. The circuit was not too hard to build because there was diagrams shown on the website (credit to Nathan's website!) </p>

  <p> This was the code I used for this sensor (once again all the credit for programming goes to Nathan!!!!): </p>

  <p> The only thing I changed with this code was I added "ln" after the print statement to see the lines for my graph. </p>

  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
int ThermistorPin = A0;
int Vo;
float R1 = 10000;
float R2, T;
float A = 3.354e-03;
float B = 2.5698e-4;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);           
}

void loop() {

  Vo = analogRead(ThermistorPin);
  R2 = R1 * 1/(1023.0 / (float)Vo - 1.0);  //Calculate resistance of thermistor from voltage divider math.
  T = (1.0 / (A + B*log(R2/R1) ));  // Calculate temperature using datasheet formula.
  T = T - 273.15;                   //Convert from Kelvin to Celcius.


 // Serial.print("Temperature: "); 
  Serial.println(T);
 // Serial.println("C"); 

  delay(500);
}
  </code></pre>

  <p> I used the same process (pretty much) with this sensor in finding the minimum and maximum values. Since this was a temperature sensor, in order to find the minimum, I pressed ice cubes against the senors, and to find the maximum I heated up my hands and put them on the sensor. The only challenging part of this part was finding ice cubes, which thanks to Emma we aquired from the Clover resturant in the lobby of the building. To control the range, all I had to do was change what object was touching the temperature sensor (cold ice or hot hand). </p>

  ![image of ice](./coldice.jpeg)

  <p> These were the maximum and minimum values that I was able to collect after repeating that process a couple of times: </p>

  #### Minimum (from ice): 15.83 C

  ![image of ice temp](./icetemp2.png)

  #### Maximum (from hand): 30.72 C

  ![image of hand temp](./blowingtemp.png)

  <p> This was also the graph from the data that I collected: </p>

  <p> I am very glad we learned about electronic input circuits this week because I am planning on using a thermistor in my final project. For my final project, I finally decided I want to make a light that changes based off of body temperature, and in order to do that I will need a temperature sensor that I can attach to a bracelet for the user to wear. I will have to learn more about transmitting data throguh wifi while making my final project, but that is a lesson to learn for the future. </p>
