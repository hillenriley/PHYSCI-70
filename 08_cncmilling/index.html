  ## Week Seven: CNC Milling, Molding, and Casting

  ### Creating a Mold in the ShopBot

  <p> This week we learned about how to use the ShotBot and the CNC machine to create molds and larger wooden shapes. I decided for this week to create a shape in the wax machine and then mold that shape with a material like plaster. This week was definetly the most chaotic out of all of the weeks so far, from the machines breaking to not having enough time, so I was not able to finish this project yet. </p>

  <p> Originally, I made plans to create the mold for a small flower that I would turn into an ice cube tray. I created my small flower design with OnShape (which turned out to be slightly problematic later) and tried to upload my STL file onto the computer attached to the machine. This machine, however, had other plans for me and decided to not accept my file (Suvin can vouch the file was fine it was the sizing), which caused so so many problems in the long run. </p>

   <p> This is a screenshot of my amazing gorgeous flower file that I never got to use because the machine only liked files made in Fusion360: </p>

  <p> After I had to accept defeat with my flower mold, I decided just to print a simple design of a heart that was already loaded into the wax machine software (credit to emma for the design!!!). This part of the process was still tricky because this software had one of the most confusing set ups that I have ever seen in my whole life. Suvin had to help me for most of this part, but after a couple of tries I was able to get my wax mold.</p>

  <p> Here is a small timeline of pictures of me carving the wax: </p>

  <p> And this was the final product from the wax machine: </p>

  <p> Even though this part of the assigment was very long and time consuming (and honestly stressful for everyone), I understand the importance of learning how to use these machines. I realized I probably should have just cut something out of wood on the CNC machine (even though that ended up breaking too) from the start because then I could have avoided the whole wax machine debacle, but I am happy with how my project turned out so far. </p>

  <p> I feel like this week also taught me the importance of understanding the mechanics behind the machines you are using. Even though I may not be the most techy person ever, I think now I have a better understanding of how to operate both of these machines, and how to debug them incase of an issue in the future. </p>

  ### Casting a Mold

  <p> For this part of the assignment, we had to cast a mold for an object. We could either use the mold we created with the wax machine, or freely cast an object in a plastic cup. Since I already had a piece cut out on the wax machine, I decided to cast a mold using my little heart (still heartbroken about my flower). On the instructional day, Nathan showed us how to use the chemicals and powder to create molds, but when it came time to do it for myself I was rather confused. </p>

  <p> My first order of business was to cut small slits in my mold on the sides of the heart because they never fully reached the side. I did this by using a box cutter to slit the sides of the wax, which was pretty easy considering the medium. </p>

  <p> After that I needed to start mixing the chemicals. This part was pretty fun but scared me slightly because I was afraid of getting the substances on my skin. The bottles on the jars said skin safe but I was still a little bit weary. The smells of mixing all of these powers and liquids together was definetly interesting, and in the words of me and my classmates, smelled like a public aquarium. </p>

  <p> All we had to do was mix the Part A and part B from the yellow containters in a cup with a popsicle stick and then pour that mixture into our molds. I could have used the spray in order to make sure that the silicon would not stick, but I completely forgot until the end. Removing the silicon from the mold would probably be smoother if I used the spray adhesive, but I think the removal process won't be too bad. </p>

  <p> After I created the mixture, I had to pour it in my mold. It wad very important while pouring to pour on an angle to minimize the amount of air bubbles inside the silicon.  </p>

  <p> Once I finished pouring all of the silicon into my molds, and getting rid of the rest, I placed my wax block onto a shelf in one of the closets to dry. These molds take anywhere inbetween 4 and 8 hours (i'm pretty sure) to dry completely to put the plaster in it. I finished these molds at the very end of my sections, like a lot of other people, so the deadline for this project ended up getting extended.</p>

 <p> As of right now, my project is looking pretty solid. When I get to the lab tomorrow, I am planning on mixing some plaster and placing it into my mold and then letting it sit overnight. </p>

<p> To be continued ... </p>
