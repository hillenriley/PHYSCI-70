  ## Week Eight: Wifi, Radio, and Bluetooth 

  <p> Disclaimed: this week was very challenging for me because my computer decided not to like working with the Arduino. I was only able to get my project to work with the help of my friend's computer who already had Arduino installed.</p>

  ### Getting an Output Through a Wireless Network 

  <p> This week we learned about how to use wifi and radio signals to gather outputs. This week is somwhat building off of what we have done previously, with using inputs to gather desired outputs, but this time it would be over a network. This whole concept, of information moving across wifi and different networks, is actually so amazing and interesting to me because I have never learned about anything like it before. Even though this week was super interesting, it definetly had its faults, and was probably one of the worst weeks for me so far. </p>

  <p> In past weeks, Arduino was working fine for me while doing projects. For some reason, however, when I went to connect my Arduino IDE to the ESP32 microcontroller, I continually got errors saying that it could not connect. The persistant errors were saying that Arduino's Wifi.h libraries were found in mulitple locations and could not be accessed in the right $PATH, pretty much meaning my ESP32 would not connect.  </p>

   <p> In order to overcome this huge problem, after spending all three hours of class trying to fix it, I decided to use the online web editor version of Arduino. This was all fine until I realized that I needed to be able to connect to a port through the website (specifically the COM4 port) and my Arduino page did not have an option for that setting. </p>

  <p> Me and Kassia spent a long time trying to debug this part of the website, and after about two paintful hours, we realized it was a problem with the downloads being in the wrong browser and a problem with thr actual download agents. After the long haul of finally trying to get my Arduino to work, I was in business to start the assignment. </p>

  <p> I began working on this assignment outside of the lab time, because I had spent all of my time trying to debug my problem, when my friend decided to inform me that his computer had Arduino installed. Just for fun I tried connecting the ESP32 to his computer to see if he would have the same error as me, and he ended up not getting it. Sebastian graciously let me use his computer to try to work on this assignment because the Arduino web IDE was lacking.</p>

  <p> Once I began working with the actual Arduino, things went pretty quick. The assignment for this week was to "Control a board from a local wireless network." and then to " "Program a microcontroller to obtain and respond to information from the internet." which was pretty simple with the RnadomNerd tutorials that Nathan provided for us.</p> 

  <p> This is the website to the RandomNerd tutorials:</p>

  <p> https://randomnerdtutorials.com/projects-esp32/</p>

  <p> And this is the link to the more specific RandomNerd tutorial that I used for my project this week:</p>

  <p> https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-web-server-arduino-ide/</p>

  <p> Following the tutorial was really easy, even though it was really long. The tutorial actually even provided me with code that would work for my Arduino completely, and I only had to change a couple of things. </p>

  <p> Since I was not working within the MAKERSPACE wifi range, I also had my friend make a wifi network from his computer, which allowed me to connect mhy Arduino to it and get the IP adress. </p>

  <p> This is a little timeline of me following the tutorial: </p>

  <p> As shown in the above photos, the output of this project was to have the different LED lights change based on the input from the website. This was actually the coolest part because I realized I could contol the lights from any device, so I plugged in the IP adress into my friends phone and started turning them on and off from that. </p> 

  <p> These were the final outputs from this weeks project: </p>

  <p> I honestly wish I could have done just a little bit more this week, either using Firebase or another networking system, but all of the problems with my Arduino and ESP32 connection really held me back. In the future, especially with my final project, I am excited to dive deeper into this concept to incorporate wifi into my projects! </p>
