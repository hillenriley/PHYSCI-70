  ## Final Project Planning Page 

  ### Coming up with the Idea 

  <p> I went through about ten (or more) iterations of my final project not only while creating it, but also coming up with ideas from it. This page represents all of my thoughts going into this project, some documented on specific dates, and some documented as a whole. The process of creating this project was probably one of the most time consuming projects I have ever completed in my life, and while it not 100% perfect, I am proud of the progress I have made compared to my skills in the beginning.   </p>

  <p> Please enjoy this timeline (below) of my thoughts as just a little peak into my thinkinh throughout the whole process. Below are three entries I had for this page while coming up with the idea, and then a photo timeline of actually creating my final project. </p>

  #### Update as of June 23rd (First Update!!!)

  <p> This week we started with planning out our final project. I am thinking that I want to do something with measuring heartrate and having that change the color and music displayed on a speaker. </p>

  <p> The user could possibly wear some sort of smart watch or chest heart monitor in order to record the heart rate, and then that data can be sent to the speaker to change its properties. This speaker could try to help reduce anxiety, if the users heart rate is too fast then light colors could be displayed on the speaker. </p>

   <p> This was my first idea: </p> 

  ![image of brainstorm](./planning1.jpg)

  <p> I have to look into the information surrounding speaker shapes to have the most optimal sound dispersion. The pieces for the speaker could probably be 3d printed and then put together to get a nice shape. </p>

  <p> These are some possible shapes: </p> 

  ![image of speaker design](./speakerdesign1.jpg)

  <p> After looking into which speaker shapes I should consider, I am also planning on looking into whether the speaker should only have the lights controlled by the heartrate, but possibly also the type (and tempo) of the music also be controlled by the user's heart </p>

  <p> Previous studies that are similar to this include some fitness watches, like popular Fitbits and Apple watches that monitor a user's heart rate while completing various activities, like swimming, running a marathon, or doing a simple workout. My project could also end up being similar to prevoiusly existing speakers that change colors depending on the tempo of the song, or even just color changing speakers as a whole. </p>

  <p> With this project, I hope to accomplish and create some sort of speaker that can help with reducing anxiety and other bad mental states. This is extremely important in modern society with the immersion of various mental health diagnoises. My speaker could be a solution to reducing some of the tensions caused by the mental illnesses, and would probably be the best suited for students located on college campuses who face large loads of stress daily. </p>

  #### Update as of July 6th (Second Update!!!)

  <p> I have really begun to start thinking about how I am going to execute this project. After talking to Suvin, I think that my biggest goal to accomplish first is creating the actual speaker, and then having the heart rate scanner come second. After thinking about this part too, I think it would probably be more beneficial (and easier) to use a temperature body scanner instead of a heart rate monitor. The colors can then change based on your body temperature instead of how fast your heart is beating.</p>

  ![image of update planning](./updateplanning.jpeg)

  <p> My backup plan for this project if all else fails is to just make a lamp that will change based on your body temperature, but I have high hopes that I will be able to create the speaker aswell.</p>

  <p> I am still working on a list of parts for this project, however, this is my first drafted list:</p>

  <p> - acrylic for the outside of the speaker (to lasercut) </p>
  <p> - speaker components (still looking into the specifics) </p>
  <p> - wood (only a little bit for the base of the speaker) </p>

  <p> I have also been looking into different videos and articles on how exactly to construct the speaker and/or lamp, and these are some of the examples I have come across for right now: </p>

  #### Update as of July 21st (Third Update!!!)

  <p> After doing a lot of thinking, and talking with Suvin and Kassia, about how my final project is going to play out, I have decided to only do the light part of my final project. I decided that taking out the speaker component for my project will allow me to focus more on crafting the input and output code for the thermistor, and save time with the limited amount we have left in this program. If this course was a full semester course, I would definetly find ways to polish this light up more and add the audio component, but it is just not viable in this short-term summer, and would hurt my project more rather than help it. </p>

  <p> I am still using the same timeline and plan to create this project. My first order ot business needs to be creating the plans to laser cut the pieces of acrylic and wood for my base and the actual light. After that, looking at the LED lights is definetly going to be an important aspect of my project. I am hoping the LED lights will not be a super hard process, as I worked on them during week five and week six, but using them on a larger scale will be interesting. </p>

  <p> For the acrylic light part of this project, I am thinking the design should be something relating back to nature or temperature. At first, I was thinking I wanted to do something with the Arctic and make the reflecting lights blue, but I am not sure if that is possible. I saw an infographic about climate change that really intrigued me the other day, so maybe my design could be loosely based off of that. </p>

  ## Creating the Final Project

  <p> This part of the final project page is somewhat of a final timeline of me creating this project, once I finally got all of my ideas together. Enjoy!</p>

  <p> These are the CAD files I created on OnShape for this project:</p>

  <p> This whole process has truly been a huge learning experience and I am so greatful to have gone through planning because it will prepare me for the future!</p>
