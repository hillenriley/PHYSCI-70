  ### Week One: Cutting 

  <p> We started this week by learning about Fusion360 and how to create shapes to laser cut inside of the program. After going through many tutorials in class, I finally decided I wanted to start creating sketches. When I tried to open Fusion, however, I realized that my computer was too old to run the program and I would have to use OnShape instead to create my project. </p>

  <p> I already have a little experience in OnShape from robotics back in my home town but I still looked at some tutorials on how to create skectches. This week's project also had us include parameters and I learned that instead of using the world "parameters" OnShape uses the word "variables" which acted pretty much the same. </p>

   <p> This is a photo and link of the online tutorial I used for my project: </p>

  <p> I followed this tutorial and decided to make my project similar and create a box with noches that stuck together. Since this assignment had to be press fit for all of the pieces together, it was very important that all of my measures were correct, especially including the kerf values. I constructed all of my sketches, with inspiration coming from the video tutorial, and they looked like this (below). </p>

  <p> These were my original shapes: </p>

  <p> After creating all of my shapes for the first time, I decided it was time to start laser cutting my pieces. I thought that all of my original measurements would be correct but after cutting I realized some of the pieces did not fit together the way I wanted to. I ended up going through three iterations in order to get the pieces the exact way I wanted them to look. </p>

  <p> When I got through my third cut, I realized that all of my pieces were finally the way I wanted them to look and I decided to begin assembling. I put all of my six individual pieces together to form my box. </p>

   <p> This was how my box looked when I was done assembling: </p>

  <p> The second part of this assignment was also to model two other household items inside of our designing program. Instead of doing household objects, I decided to measure and sketch out items found inside the lab. I used a calliper to measure a small roll of white tape and my phone to create models of. For me, I ended up doing all of my modeling inside of OnShape because my Fusion still does not work. </p>

  <p> These are the obects I chose to use and their measurements: </p>

  <p> I had to look at some online sources in order to complete my models, but I ended up creating two semi-decent models. Enjoy my OnShape models of the small roll of white tape and my phone. </p>
