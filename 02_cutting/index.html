  ### Week One: Cutting 

  <p> This week we started with planning out our final project. I am thinking that I want to do something with measuring heartrate and having that change the color and music displayed on a speaker. </p>

  <p> The user could possibly wear some sort of smart watch or chest heart monitor in order to record the heart rate, and then that data can be sent to the speaker to change its properties. This speaker could try to help reduce anxiety, if the users heart rate is too fast then light colors could be displayed on the speaker. </p>

   <p> This was my first idea: </p>

  <p> I have to look into the information surrounding speaker shapes to have the most optimal sound dispersion. The pieces for the speaker could probably be 3d printed and then put together to get a nice shape. </p>

  <p> These are some possible shapes: </p>

  <p> After looking into which speaker shapes I should consider, I am also planning on looking into whether the speaker should only have the lights controlled by the heartrate, but possibly also the type (and tempo) of the music also be controlled by the user's heart </p>

  <p> Previous studies that are similar to this include some fitness watches, like popular Fitbits and Apple watches that monitor a user's heart rate while completing various activities, like swimming, running a marathon, or doing a simple workout. My project could also end up being similar to prevoiusly existing speakers that change colors depending on the tempo of the song, or even just color changing speakers as a whole. </p>

  <p> With this project, I hope to accomplish and create some sort of speaker that can help with reducing anxiety and other bad mental states. This is extremely important in modern society with the immersion of various mental health diagnoises. My speaker could be a solution to reducing some of the tensions caused by the mental illnesses, and would probably be the best suited for students located on college campuses who face large loads of stress daily. </p>
